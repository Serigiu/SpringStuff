/**
 * As you can see that our application classes are responsible only for using the service. Service classes are created in injectors. 
 * Also, if we have to further extend our application to allow facebook messaging, we will have to write a new service class and injector class only. 
 * So dependency injection implementation solved the problem with hard-coded dependency and helped us in making our application flexible and easy to extend. 
 * Now letâ€™s see how easily we can test our application class by mocking the injector and service classes.
